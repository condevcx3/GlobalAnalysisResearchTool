Primary education programs may also be referred to as elementary education or basic education, but in basic education, primary education is only the first stage/lower grades. Basic education can be coded as both Primary and Secondary education subsectors since they typically range from primary to lower secondary. \nPrimary education programs are typically designed to provide students with fundamental skills in reading, writing and mathematics and establish a solid foundation for learning in preparation for lower secondary education. They focus on learning at a basic level of complexity with little, if any, specialization. \nAge is typically the only entry requirement at this level. The customary or legal age of entry is usually not below 5 years old nor above 7 years old. This level typically lasts six years, although its duration can range between four and seven years. Primary education typically lasts until age 10 to 12. Upon completion of primary education programs, children may continue their education in lower secondary education (ISCED level 2).

        "WorldBankDefinition": "Secondary education programs include both lower/junior secondary and upper/senior secondary education and general secondary vocational tracks. Programs at this level are typically designed to build on the learning outcomes from primary education, and are usually organized around a more subject-oriented curriculum that introduces theoretical concepts across a broad range of subjects. Teachers typically have pedagogical training in specific subjects and, more often than in primary education, a class of students may have several teachers with specialized knowledge of the subjects they teach. \nLower secondary education corresponds with the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) level 2 and can be referred to as junior secondary, lower secondary, middle school, or junior high school. The later grades of basic education programs are also lower secondary education. Lower secondary typically ends 8 to 11 years after the start of primary education with 9 years being the most widespread cumulative duration. At the end of lower secondary, pupils are typically aged 14 to 16 years. \nUpper secondary education corresponds with ISCED level 3 and can be referred to as senior secondary, high school, or senior high school. These programs are typically designed to prepare students for tertiary education or provide skills relevant to employment, or both. Programs at this level offer student more varied, specialized and in-depth instruction than lower secondary programs. They are more differentiated with an increased range of options and streams available. Teachers are often highly qualified in the subjects or fields of specialization they teach – particularly in the higher grades. \nUpper secondary education begins 8 to 11 years after the beginning of primary education, typically when pupils are between ages 14 and 16. Upper secondary ends 12 or 13 years after the beginning of primary education or around age 17 or 18, with 12 years being the most widespread cumulative duration.",
