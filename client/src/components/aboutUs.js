      <br></br>
      <p style = {{fontSize: "25px"}}>This platform visualises data on girls’ and women’s education initiatives in Asia supported by private foundations and private-sector impact investing organisations.
      The sub-sample of initiatives and financers presented here is extracted from the larger original regional Invest-ED Database on non-state private financers of education in
      East Asia and the Pacific and South Asia.</p><br></br>
      <p style = {{fontSize: "25px"}}>The Invest-ED Database includes publicly available data on a range of non-state private financers of education, their co-financing and implementing partners, and funded education initiatives.
      The non-state private financers in the database were extracted from five global and regional sources.</p><br></br>
      <p style = {{fontSize: "25px"}}>Education initiatives that were operational in 2015, 2016, or 2017 are included. They may have started
      before or ended after these years.</p><br></br>
      <p style = {{fontSize: "25px"}}>The Invest-ED Database has data on the geographic concentrations of activity, education sub-sectors, programming areas, and activities. Only initiatives with an explicit focus on girls’ and
      women’s education are included in the data visualization platform here.</p><br></br>
      <p style = {{fontSize: "25px"}}>We are interested in expanding the database. If you are a financer or implementing partner of education initiatives in Asia and/or if there are data here that require updating, please contact us.</p>
